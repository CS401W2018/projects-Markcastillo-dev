        <h1 id="hero-title">My Hero - Aquaman</h1>
        <p class="highlight">This is an important part of the story.</p>
        <p>The next ruler is Arthur Curry, who answers to the name Aquaman when he’s around others, is a crossbreed between Tom Curry and Atlanna who is the queen, and battles Doctor Stephen Anatol Lang who is the presenter at the National Bureau of Consensus. 
            And he is also a member of the Justice League, at the same time, is a would-be, part-time, or an on-and-off dialectical king – atsim.
            Aquaman's story explores themes of identity, belonging, and the balance between two worlds, making him a complex and enduring figure in the superhero genre.
