    <h1>Welcome to my profile! My name is Mark Castillo</h1>

    <p>I was born in Quezon City, Philippines, and I'm currently studying Information Technology in Hawaii. I'm in my sophomore year now, but studying isn't really my thing. In my free time, I love playing Crossfire, watching funny videos, browsing social media, and heading to the beach every afternoon to swim &amp; watch the sunset. </p>
    
    <p> Since 2021, I had been looking for someone to date, and then I met Carla. We took the time to get to know each other and found a strong connection through our common interests. We've been dating for 3 years now, and we've been engaged for 2 months. We're excited to be planning our wedding this year! </p>
