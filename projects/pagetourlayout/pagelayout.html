                First, you must picture in your mind! It was a boring afternoon, and I was too cool for school right there, just scrolling down my Facebook news feed. And then BOOM! There flashed a notification. I was like, "Oh, well. Another like or comment," but as I saw it, it was a post from a friend of a friend.
                Not much, actually, just the usual likes and comments, but then, WHOOOSH, my eyes widened: Carla. And the profile picture? OMG, her image was like the sun after a rainy day! It felt so friendly and warm, like it was saying, "Hey, I'm cool! Wanna know more?"
                And, well...click! I just had to check out her profile. My brain was like, "WHO IS THIS AWESOME PERSON?!" And that's where it all started.

                Innocent as it was, we first met when I sent her a friend request and found to my surprise that she accepted. Initially, we exchanged a few likes and comments on posts, but then we seemed to have delved deeper into conversations about interests and dreams and the trivialities of life. These evolved into talking about favorite movies and songs and later graduated to long-deep nighttime conversations that involved sharing dreams and hopes for the future, adventure fantasies, and even fears.

            <h2>Knowing Each Other on Facebook</h2>

                We had spent weeks messaging before giving that leap of faith to meet in person. The chemistry? Undeniable. Every moment felt as if it had been leading up to this moment, with fate using the virtual world to sweep us across the landscape to one another in reality. The longer we spent time together, the more certain I became that this was really the thing.

            <p>
                Over the years, the bond we share has grown even stronger with every passing moment in time. Those moments which we had shared made us laugh, and it supported us through those trying times and solidified what had formed through our initial meeting online. And even today, as we prepare to step into the future together, every time I look back at that one Facebook notification, I smile. It's remarkable how such a simple thing led to the person I love with all my heart, Carla.

            <p>Together, we know this is just the beginning of our forever.</p>
