                It all started with a simple notification on a quiet afternoon. As I was scrolling through my Facebook feed, I stumbled upon a mutual friend's post. Among the sea of likes and comments, one name caught my eye—Carla. There was something about her smile in her profile picture that instantly captivated me. It felt warm and inviting, and before I knew it, I was clicking on her name to learn more about this intriguing woman.

            Our initial connection was innocent enough. I sent her a friend request, and to my delight, she accepted. We exchanged a few casual likes and comments on each other’s posts, but soon our conversations drifted into deeper topics—our interests, dreams, and the little quirks of life. What started as small talk about our favorite movies and music evolved into long, late-night chats. We shared our hopes for the future, our love for adventure, and even our fears.

            I couldn’t deny it—there was something special about Carla. Her wit, her kindness, and her ability to see beauty in even the simplest things made her stand out to me. Slowly but surely, I realized this was more than just a digital connection.

            After weeks of messaging back and forth, we decided to take a leap of faith and meet in person. The chemistry was undeniable. Every moment felt like it had been building toward this encounter, as if fate had guided us through the virtual world to find each other in reality. The more time we spent together, the more certain I became that this was the real thing.

            As the years passed, our bond only grew stronger. The shared moments, the laughter, and the support we offered each other during tough times reinforced what we had first discovered online. And now, as we prepare to walk down the aisle, I often look back at that one Facebook notification and smile. It’s amazing how something so simple led me to the love of my life, Carla.
            
            Together, we know this is just the beginning of our forever.
